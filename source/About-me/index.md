Hi I'm Carol

And I made this

I'm a recent graduate from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in [Culinology] 

I'm currently living in Austin, TX.  

I like cats, sewing, crocheting, knitting, spinning, cooking, baking, and soap making.  But you probably knew that.  

You can contact me at carolmadethis.com@gmail.com
