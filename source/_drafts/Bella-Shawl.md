In 2015 I spent a semester in Heidelberg Germany.  I enjoyed my time there very much, but I wanted to take a knitting project, one that would take quite a bit of time, as I didn't want to finish it in the first week.  

I decided to create the [Bella Botanica Shawl] It didn't look too hard, but would be interesting enough to hold my interest.  

I cast on around March 1st.  As this was my first time I quickly got confused with the charts and making sure everything was in order.  So I frogged it and started over.  This time went much better and I quickly got going.

There are three charts that you an repeat to change the size of the shawl.  As I was using a lace weight yarn, I chose to follow the recomended number of repeats.  

The charts were fairly easy to memorize, and I didn't have too much trouble for my first time following a chart.  

I chose not to create any nupps, but I did add beads.  She recomends a method for adding beads that worked very well.  

At the time I didn't realize how important binding off is, and so the bind off is too tight and doesn't allow for the pointed edge.  

Shortly after I got back I made a sundress that's a dark red with black/brown accents.  This shawl is perfet to wear, to keep a chill off your shoulders or just enlongate the wearing time of the sundress.  
If I wasn't the sort of person who prefers something new all the time, I would knit this shawl again in a heartbeat.
