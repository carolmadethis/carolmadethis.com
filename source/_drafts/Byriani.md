When I was in college I started liking non-American/European food.  Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Ethiopian.  I especially liked Indian food.  At that point I was just starting to be vegetarian, and those cusines make it a lot easier to eat without meat.

In one of my classes I had to make a dish from another culture, and document it.  I chose to make Biryani.  And so began my love of the dish.

Did you know there are two types of rice dishes in India?  Pualo and Biryani.  Pualo is a rice dish where the rice, seasonings, vegetables, and broth are simmered together to cook the rice.  Biryani on the other hand is par-boiled rice, layered with par-cooked vegetables in a tomato based sauce, and baked or cooked over low heat.

I've been perfecting my Biryani for some time now, and I think I've got it.  It uses every pan in the house, but it's worth it.

__Biryani__
1 large onion, sliced
1 T oil

2 cups mixed diced vegetables
	cauliflower
    green beans
    carrots
    potatoes
    bell peppers
    tofu
1/2 cup cashews 
1/2 cup plain yogurt 
1 t tumeric
1 t salt

1 cup Basmati rice, washed and soaked for 15 mins
4 cups water
1 t oil
1 cinnamon stick
1 bay leaf
2-4 peppercorns
2-4 whole cloves
1 star anise
small pinch saffron
2 T warm milk (I use [soy milk])

1 T oil
1 t cumin seeds
1 t fenugreek
1/2 t fennel seeds
2 T garlic ginger paste
1 green chili, minced
4-5 tomatoes, chopped
1/2 cup peas

1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup slivered almonds
- In a large sautee pan over low heat carmalize onions.  I start this first thing, before I've prepped anything else; it will take a long time.  
- In a large bowl combine vegetables, cashews, yogurt, tumeric, and salt.  
- In a large sauce pan bring water, oil, and all seasonings except saffron to a boil.  Add rice and cook for 5 minutes.  Drain.  Mix saffron and milk, let sit 5 minutes, and pour over rice.  
- In a large pan heat oil over medium high heat.  Add cumin, fenugreek, and fennel.  Let toast for 10-30 seconds.  Add garlic ginger paste and green chili.  Let cook further for 30 seconds.  Add tomatoes and cover and let stew for 5 minutes.  Add vegetable-yogurt mixture and let cook until carrots and potatoes are just begnning to soften.  Mix in peas.  There should be a fair amount of liquid (1 cup), if not add 1/2 cup water.    
- In a deep greased casserole dish with a lid, layer 1/3 rice, 1/2 vegetables, 1/3 onions, 1/3 raisins and almonds.  Repeat.  The last layer should be rice, onions, raisins and almonds.  
- Optional, pour 1/4 cup melted butter over the top.  
- Cover dish and bake in a pre-heated 350 degree oven for 30 minutes.  
- Let stand 5 minutes and serve.
