My hair likes change.  In fact, if I try to use the same shampoo and conditoner too long, my hair rebels and goes limp and dull.  Switching immediatly gives life back to my hair.  

Now, one of the things that I've noticed makes my hair go limp FASTER is dimethicone.  It's a common ingredient in many mid-range conditioners and sometimes even shampoos.  It leaves hair very silky, and smooth, and managable.  The only problems is it's not water soluble, so it needs detergents to get it out, otherwise there's build up, and whoops, we're back to limp town!

I've played with using bar soap for my hair with a vinegar rinse, and that works, for a while.  

So, now I'm trying bar conditioner.  I don't expect it to be something I can use for the rest of time.  But hopefully I'll get a month out of it.  

I found a basic recipe on __[herpackinglist]__.  So I followed it.  That turned out pretty good, but if I'm using bar soap, that'll leave my scalp very basic, and a healthy scalp is an acidc one.  And this bar is neutral.  So I added citric acid to lower the pH a little.  And because we're experimenting, I added glycerin to see what that would do (thus far, it's made it not solidify)  


The results:
