Crepes are delicious.  In our family we like to eat them with butter and cinnamon sugar.

I've also eaten them with nuttella, fruit compote, or fresh fruit.  Delicious, no matter the time of day.

Our 'traditional' recipe is made with a baking mix, eggs and milk.  I'm not a huge fan of eggs and milk these days, so I usually substitue vegan eggs and soy milk.  Easy right?

When I was making my [sourdough] post I found this [crepe] recipe.  It's got the same 'problem' as our 'traditional' recipe, but just like the 'traditional' recipe, it's an easy fix.

__Crepes__

1 cup sourdough starter
3 vegan eggs^
2 tbsp. melted margerine
1/4 tsp. salt
1/4 to 1/2 cup soy milk (to thin batter^^)
**Optional: 1-2 tbsp. sugar

- Mix everything together in a large jug.  
- Cook in a preheated, greased skillet until golden brown, flipping at least once.  For a 6 inch skillet use about 1/4 cup of batter per crepe, for a 10 inch skillet use about 1/3 cup.  Adjust to your preference.  
- Seve warm.

^Use your favorite substitues.  I've used flax eggs, VeganEgg, and a freebie made from apples.  Something that sets when cooked is best.
^^The starter plus eggs makes just shy of 3 cups.  I added enough milk to make 3 cups.  My starter is euqal parts flour and water by weight.  Crepe batter should be quite thin, you want the batter to form a thin 'skin' on the pan when you cook it.
