As I do every year, I make something rather than buy for a Christmas present.  

This year, due to circumstances outside my control, we didn't gather with the extended family, and we also agreed not to send anything through the mail.  That just left my coworkers.  I've long kept a list of their favorite color, so it was easy to pick a pallete.  Some of them were easier than others. For example; my boss often remarks that he's cold.  So I made him microwaveable hand warmers.

His boss, who sits in our office, loves the office.  So I made him a wall hanging.

One of the managers is "the bag lady", so I made her a tote bag.

The junior manager often wears scrunchies, and her favorite color is black, so I made some black scrunchies.  [post about making scrunchies]

The last manager and the newst technologist were both hard to decide.  I love these little pouches [post about them!] and I know the manager has one for her nail kit.  So I made one in their favorite color(s).

The last person in the office is the senior R&D chef, and he's got two great loves; bowling and eating.  I tried to find something I could make that was bowling related, but nothing seemed right.  So I made him two cookies in a jar.

Each item was hand made. The bags were all made with a quilt block that had an added piece of fabric to make the block rectangular.  The microwaveable handwamers are filled with rice and made with 100% cotton fabric and thread.  

I had a bunch of fun making these items, and I sure hope they enjoy them!
