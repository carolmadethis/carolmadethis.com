Your hair is a wonderful thing, and yet sometimes we don't take care of it the way we should. 

A fun mask to play with for oily hair is a ripe banana, egg whites, cinnamon, honey, and lemon juice.  

Mix everything together until it's a smooth mask and put on your hair.  Leave until you can't stand it anymore and rinse out.  

it's easy, fun, and your hair will feel nice when it's done!
