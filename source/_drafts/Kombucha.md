Kombucha is entering mainstream in a way that it hasn't, more and more grocery stores have bottles of this fizzy drink on their shelves.  Unfortunatly it costs between 3 and 4 dollars to buy, but costs pennies to make!

Kombucha at it's heart is cultured sweet tea.  A great basic recipe is 8 black tea bags, 1 cup of white sugar, 1 gallon of water, and about 1/4 to 1/2 cup plain kombucha (usually from a previous batch) 



Kombucha is this magical drink.  Some have heard of it, and some have not.  It's not that hard to make, and is a good for you fizzy drink!  

Komucha, at it's most basic, is a fermented sweet tea.  

Generally speaking the repice (for 1 gallon of kombucha) is 8 tea bags, 1 cup white sugar, and 1 gallon water.  

Kombucha is made with a SCOBY (symbiotic colony of bateria and yeast) the yeast create the fiz, and the bacteria create the flavor.  

There are many different ways to get a SCOBY, either order one online (be careful about the suplier) get one from someone local, or grow it youself.  Growing your own SCOBY isn't that hard, but be sure to be patient.  Simply make some starter tea, and add 1 cup of it to 3 cups of plain kombucha.  Let sit for 2+ weeks, and wow!  You've got SCOBY beginning to grow!
