A little while back I was in the mood for soup.  A bit weird as it was June in Texas, but hey, sometimes we want weird things.  

I had a sweet potato to use up, so I was thinking about sweet potato in soup, and peanut soup came to mind, that beautiful orange color.  So I looked at a few recipes, and made some soup.  

I generally don't like spicy foods.  Don't get me wrong, I like spice, but so-hot-you-can't-breath isn't very appealing.  However, this soup wanted a kick to it, and I think I've struck that nice balance between heat and hot.  Of course, you can change it however you like!

__Peanut Soup__
Oil
Onion
Garlic
Potato
Peanuts
Vegetable broth
Hot Sauce (I used siracha)

Saute the onions in oil until soft and beginning to brown around the edges.  
Add the garlic and potato and saute for 30 seconds.  Add the broth and peanuts.  Pressure cook for 2 minutes, or boil until the sweet potato is very soft.  
Blend until smooth.

Add hot sauce to taste, and adjust seasonings to your liking.

Serve with chopped peanuts, or fried onion.
