That's pi.  It's not very delicious, but it's still fun to use.  

A while back I got the idea for a pi scarf.  This was around the time I was making [my first shawl] so I had lace on the brain.  

I decided to make something I've never seen before.  A pi scarf!  

Each line of the scarf corresponds to a digit of pi.  And the distance between the holes indicates the number.  

It's more artsy than practical, but hey, nerds like scarves too!  

I made it by more or less making up the pattern as I went.  

Just recently I've decided to write down the pattern for others.  You can find it on Ravelry [link here]

It's easy to make as there is no gauge, although looser is better to see the holes, and the only requirment for the width is multiples of 10 stiches plus 4.  Additionally, the length can be as short or as long as you like.  After all, pi doesn't end, why should your scarf?
