Pretzels are delicious.  Warm and soft, day old toasted with a little mustard.  Brush with melted butter when it comes out of the oven.  I've drooling just thinking about it!  

As you saw in my post about [sourdough] there are a million ways to use discard sourdough starter.  Well, maybe not a million, but there sure are a lot!  

One of which is pretzels.  Now depending on your starter, these may be very sour, or just have a slight tang.  My starter isn't very sour yet, so the tang is just barely there.  

I bascially followed this [pretzel] recipe, with a few changes.  

PRETZELS
3/4 cup lukewarm water
1 cup sourdough starter, unfed/discard
3 cups Bread Flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon margerine
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons instant yeast
1-2 tablespoons soy milk

1/2 cup baking soda

1 tablespoon kosher salt, or other large grain salt

- In a medium to large bowl, mix everything together, taking care to not let the yeast and salt touch before mixing into the flour.  Add a touch more soy milk if the dough is too shaggy, but it will be a soft dough.  
- Knead by throwing the dough onto the counter "slap and fold" for a few minutes.  The dough will get noticably softer, and begin to hold together and strech rather tear.  
- Place back in the bowl and cover with a damp tea towel.  Let rest and rise for 45 minutes.  
- Pre-heat oven to 350 F.  Boil aprox. 1 1/2 quarts of water in a 3 quart pan.  Once boiling add baking soda and reduce heat until ready to use.  (It will act very weird, and almost splatter)
- Divide the dough into 12 equal portions.  Roll each piece into a long cylinder about 18-24 inches long.  Shape into a pretzel shape and place on parchment paper.  
- Once all pretzels have been shaped, carfully lift off parchment with a slotted spatula and lower into the boiling soda-water.  Boil for 30 seconds and place back on parchment.  Sprinkle with salt.  Repeat for remaining pretzels.  Once all pretzels have been dipped, bake for 25 miuntes, or until pretzels are a deep brown color, rotating pans once.  
- Serve with mustard and enjoy!
