I recently found a new quilt supply store near me.  It's in a house that's been {remodelded but different] and is so cute!

The really really nice quilting fabric is a bit out of my budget, but the mini charm packs by Moda aren't going to break the bank!  

I was there in October, and I got two pack.  A halloween themed pack, and an autumn themed pack.
