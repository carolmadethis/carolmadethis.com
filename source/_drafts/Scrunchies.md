Scrunchies.  The classic 1990s accessory that's making a comeback recently.  A fashion accessory and a hair accessory!  

You'd think they're easy to make, but alas, the classic 'elastic in a tube of fabric' doesn't always work!  

It might look cute in your hair, but it becomes a bangle bracelet on your wrist.  

I wanted to make a scrunchie that stood up nicely on the wrist.  

I made several versions, changing the amount of fabric and shape until I ended up at the logical conclusion.  If you want a circle not a cylinder, you need to start with a circle.  

I used premade hair elastics as the base, rather than cut elastic to size.  Depending on the size and style, some strech more than others.  This creates a scrunchie that works better on thinner hair, I've got thick hair so my scrunchie really only goes around two times.  

You want to inside circumfrance of the scrunchie to be at least the length of the fully streched hair elastic.  I like to add another 1/4 to give extra scrunch.  ie if your streched length is 16 inches, add another 4 inches. For a total of 20 inch circumfirance.  To determine the radius, divide by (2xpi) which is about 3.  

Next, you need to figure out how "tall" you want the scrunchie to be.  2 to 3 inches is a pretty good length.  Add .5 inches to your measurement, for seam allowance (.25 inches on both sides).  Add this to the original radius.  In our example this would be 3+3=6.  

Now to draw the pattern.  You'll need a piece of paper, a pencil, and a ruler / piece of yarn or a compass.  

We're going to make a quarter circle, which fits better onto a standard piece of paper.  

Place either the center point of the compass in one corner, or measure with the ruller / piece of yarn 3 inches and draw a quarter circle - from one edge of the page to the next.  Measuring from the same center point, add another 3 inches to the radius and draw another quarter circle.  

Cut this arc out.  

Now to cut out fabric!

Scrunchies are great scrap fabric projects, except with this method, you do need a fair amount of fabric.

Depending on the amount of fabric you have, you can either cut out the pieces on the fold, minimizing the amount of seams you have to sew, or cut out the pieces individually.  You'll need 8 quarters.  If you cut out each piece individually, make sure to add seam allowance to join them together.  

Then sew each piece together until you have two circles.  

Make sure you either cut through the circles, or don't sew the last seam.  This will be important later.  

Place the two circles, right sides together with the open ends lined up and sew around the center circle.  Leave about 1/4" open on each side for later.  

This next part takes a little practice.  

Now we're going to sew the other edge closed.  Place the hair elastic in between the first seam and the seam being sewed.  The fabric will enclose the hair elastic.  It will bunch up while you're sewing.  This is okay. Leave about 1/4" open on each side.   

With both sides of the circle sewn, turn the tube inside out.  The best way to do this is attached a safety pin and pass it through the middle.  Adjust the way the fabric lays.  Make sure the seams aren't twisted.  

Now we're going to sew the edges of the two circles closed.  

Take each side of the circle, on the same side, and face them right sides together, you many have to adjust the fabric to get the sewing machine over it.  Sew the seam.  Adjust the seam so it sits on the inside.  Repeat with the seam on the other side.  

You should now have a complete tube with two small gaps on the edges. Either top stich over it to close or hand sew to close.  

Tada!  A scrunchie that looks cute on your hair AND on your wrist.
