I've been looking at various food blogs for inspiration.  I tend to find a blog that looks promising, and look around for a while and get inspiration.  
One of the blogs was talking about making a turkey flavored seitan to have on a sandwich or something.  And I'm rather obsesed with my new instant pot.  So I wanted to use my instant pot
So then I had to figure out how to cook seitan in a pressure cooker, and that took me down a rabbit hole to seitan cooking.  

But then I made seitan, and it's delicious!   

Seitan

1 T garbanzo bean flour
5-6 T vital wheat gluten
1 t nutritional yeast
1/8 t each garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, poultry seasoning, thyme, rosemary, chives, sage, mustard powder, and oregano
1 t tomato paste
1/8 t salt
1 t soy sauce
1 cup vegetable broth

2 cups broth
2 cups water
1/8 t liquid smoke
2 t soy sauce

Mix the dry ingredients together and add the tomato paste, soy sauce, and 3/4 of the broth.  
Mix together and continue adding broth until a firm dough forms.  Knead for a minute to make sure everything is well combined.  
Form into an oblong log, wrap in cheesecloth, firmly tie the end (leave some space either around, or on the end for expansion)
Place broth, water, liquid smoke, and soy sauce in an instant pot (or pressure cooker), and place the log in the broth.
Close the lid, and if you have an instant pot, set the pressure cooker time for 30 minutes.  
Let naturally release for 10 minutes, or more.  Remove the log from the broth and let cool on your counter for 10-30 minutes.  
Once a more reasonable temperature cut off the cheesecloth, and place in a bag or plastic wrap and chill until completly cool (1+ hours)
Slice thin, and eat on sandwiches!
