My extended family is pretty big, so to keep everything neat a tidy at christmas, and to make sure everyone gets at least one present, we draw names from a hat to determine who you're giving something to.  

The Siblings and Spouses are one group and the cousins are the other group.  (There are now 6 great-grandchildren, so who knows what'll change, but still).  One of my cousins Loves snowflakes, anything to do with them, coasters, dishes, mugs, candle holders, hair clips, blankets, you name it, she probably has it.  

In the past I've made her little crocheted coaster snowflakes, and she loved them.  

I've also made my family unique little gifts, all the cousins got crocheted hats one year, all the aunts got a doily another year.  Two years ago I got everyone [homemade soaps].  

So last Christmas I had decided I wanted to make my Cousin who loves snowflakes a snowflake shawl.  I love [making] shawls, [they're] the perfect blend of complex so I don't get board, and repeating so I don't have to focus 100% on them.  

So I searched and searched and looked and looked and none of the shawls I found had the pattern I wanted, so I made up my [own].  A shawl is a pretty easy thing to make up.  A triangular shawl often has a pattern.  Small repeating pattern at the base to create a base that determines the final size, a middle sized pattern repeated once or twice depending on final size, and a final large pattern just repeated once.  

Not all triangular shawls have this pattern, but quite a few of them do.  So I used this method and came up with 3 lace patterns to use to make my snowflake shawl.  The first one is a snowflake/flower pattern that repeats over 8 stiches, and 16 rows (8 knit, 8 purl).  It's repeated 5 times for a total of 12 snowflakes on the last repeat.  

Then the pattern switches to a 6 sided snowflake that's 13 stiches by 26 rows (13 knit, 13 purl).  Snowflakes are 6 pointed in nature, however that's much harder to create on a grid pattern without fuding it, so most patterns have 8 sided snowflakes.  I decided I wanted to at least pretend I was accurate in creating a snowflake out of yarn, so I made up this pattern.  It's repeated 6 times accross the shawl and then repeated again, but with 8 repeats this time.  

Then it's time for the big one!  This monster snowflake is 27 stiches by 50 rows (25 knit, 25 purl) and is repeated 6 times across the length of the shawl.  I found several different shawls using this pattern.  It's 8 sided, so isn't accurate to the real world, but then again, this is yarn, so it's not a real snowflake anyway.  I did tweak the pattern slightly, making the symetry a little better than the originals.  

At the end of the shawl the last row is 437 stiches across, 218 per side plus the center stich.  

This pattern does assume you have a basic understanding of how to make a shawl, and how to read charts.  Maybe one day I'll go back and create a written outline of the shawl, but for now, I'll it's a only in chart form.
