I've recently started making soap.  It's fun, not that hard, and going to be all my Christmas presents this year.

I'm planning currently on making an assorted chocolates type gift.  This will make it easy to say what each item is, and a fun and cute way to display them.  My current issue is finding a box and paper cups for display, but I'm sure I'll find something when I go out looking.

I'm giving up to 9 different items.  (very exciting, I know)

A hair soap with about 15% <a href="https://www.soapqueen.com/bath-and-body-tutorials/cold-process-soap/superfatting-soap-an-explanation-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">superfat</a> and just three oils (shea, coconut, and olive oil in equal parts)

A body soap with 15 % superfat (probably, I forgot to write down what I did, and I don't remember!)

A regular bar soap with about 5% superfat and 25% coconut oil and 75% olive oil

Laundry Soap with 0% superfat (although I think it ended up being ~1%) and 30% palm oil (although it may have been 25% (accounting for the higher superfat)) and 70% coconut oil

Lotion bar with equal parts coconut oil, shea butter, and beeswax.

Chapstick

Liquid Soap (think Dr. Bronners Castile Soap)

Shaving soap for my uncle who uses it

And a decorative soap (mostly for color)
