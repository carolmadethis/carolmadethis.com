Have you ever wondered how to make the perfect loaf of bread?  

Have you ever watched a baking show where they talk about "This bread was under proved?" and wondered what the heck that looks like?  

Well I have, so I did a little experiment to find out what those looked like.  

I have three categories, kneading, proving, and baking.  

And in each category I have 3 options, under, middle, over.  

So, Underknead, middle knead, over knead. 
Under prove, middle prove, over prove.
Under bake, middle bake, over bake.  

Some of these you may not have seen before, or aren't a common problem, expecially in home bakers, but never the less, I wanted to be complete.

I followed a basic bread recipe, water, yeast, flour, and salt.  

I started with my water and yeast, and let them sit for a while.  

They I added the flour and salt a just brought it together to a cohesive dough.  

I realize that the underkneading most bakers do it not this extreme, but at this point I portioned off a bun to show underkneading.  

The remianing dough was kneaded to the right consistancy, and a windowpane test showed it was just about right.  

I then portioned off a bun and continued to knead it a further 5 minutes, making the gluten over develop.  

All 3 balls (2 small and one large) were placed in bowls and left to prove in a warm spot for about an hour.  

The large ball was then diveded into 7 balls and all 9 balls were shaped into a bun.  1 bun was baked after resting for only 5 minutes, the remining 8 were rested for 30-45 minutes to allow for a second rise, and 7 were put in the over at this point.  The 9th bun waited a futher 30 minutes to really over prove.  

Once in the oven each bun was cooked to ~190 F, except for one that was cooked to 170 and one cooked to 210.  

All the buns were placed on a rack to cool, and only once cool were they sliced into.  

Results

They are very subtle differences, especially as each bun is only about 50g.  

The biggest differences are in the different kneading times.  The underknead has a spot of flour, and a fairly open crumb. The over knead has several air pockets, and a somewhat tigheter crumb.  
The underprove is comparetivly tough, and has a tear on the outside where the pressure from the inside has not had enough space to move.
