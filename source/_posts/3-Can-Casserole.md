This is a mini series on recipes I developed in College, which allowed me to graduate with honors.  

There are 8 in total, and this recipe may be the easiest.

I came up with it because I wanted a recipe that was easy, nutritious, and delicious.

*3 Can Casserole*
1 15 oz can vegetable, I usually use corn
1 15 oz can bean, I usually use black eyed peas
1 15 oz can tomato, I usually use peite dieced tomato
1 cup long grain rice
1 t Garlic powder
1 t Minced onion
Salt**

- In a baking dish combine everything.  
- Cover and bake at 350 for 1 hour, stirring once. If the rice looks cooked, but there is still a lot of liquid, uncover and cook for 20 minutes.  
- Once done let sit covered for 10 minutes.  Serve.

**I usually don't add salt because the cans are all salted, but feel free to add any other seasonings you want.  
1 cup of dried rice makes a lot of cooked rice, if you'd like you can drain the vegetable and only add 3/4 c rice.  
You can also cook this on the stove top, but I find it's easier to cook in an oven.
