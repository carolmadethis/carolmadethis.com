A fantastic egg substitute, if you've never heard of it, is the <a href="https://followyourheart.com/veganegg/">VeganEgg</a> by Follow Your Heart.  You can make scrambled eggs, custards, crepes, or really, anything that uses an egg.  It's the best thing since sliced bread.  (well, for vegans anyway)

I've made vegan french toast before, without the VeganEgg.  It has satisfied my french toast craving, but it's nothing to write home about.  This french toast is.

It's custard-y; it's creamy; it's rich without being over powering; it's just a little sweet; and oh so good.

And it's simple to make.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">French Toast</span>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">1 VeganEgg (prepared per package instructions)</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">1/4 c soymilk (I use <a href="https://carolscreation.wordpress.com/2017/11/04/soy-milk/">homemade</a>)</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">1 T sugar</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">1 t vanilla</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">1/4 t cinammon</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">pinch nutmeg</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">pinch salt</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">water to thin, 2-4 T</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">2-4 slices of bread, depending on thickness.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">butter - as needed</p>
*If you can, let your slices sit out overnight, or about 8 hours. This will help the batter absorb better, making a better french toast.  But if you don't, it's just as good.
<ul>
	<li>Mix together all the ingredients except the bread.</li>
	<li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat.  Soak the bread in the batter.  Add butter to the skillet and place the bread in it.   Cook until golden brown, the batter will turn a golden brown around the edges.  Flip and cook a few minutes more.</li>
	<li>Serve warm with fresh fruit, and maple syrup, as desired.</li>
</ul>
