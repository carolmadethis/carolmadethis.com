This is the second recipe in my mini series.  

I got the inspiration for the cheeze from [Maple Spice]

It's not hard to make, and like many of my recipes you can change it up however you like.

_Margherita Pizza_
1/4 c almond flour
1 T water
1 t lemon juice
1/2 t garlic powder
1 pizza crust, any style
1 large handful kale, you will need more than you think
1/4 sun dried tomatoes, soaked in water and chopped

- In a small bowl mix together the almond flour, water, lemon, and garlic to form a stiff paste.  
- Place kale on crust, then sun dried tomatoes, and finally blob on the almond feta paste.  
- Bake according to the directions of your pizza crust, generally 450 for 10-20 minutes depending on crust thickness.  
- Remove from oven and cut into slices.

You'll want to have the kale on the bottom, the weight of the other ingredients will help keep everything from going everywhere, but this pizza does not stick together as well as a normal cheese pizza, so keep that in mind.
