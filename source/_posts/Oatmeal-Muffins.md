__Oatmeal Muffins__

2/3 c flour
1/3 c whole wheat flour
1/2 c shortening
1 t baking powder
1/2 t salt
3 T sugar
1/3 c brown sugar
1 T flax
1 c oats
1 1/4 c milk (I use [soy])

- In a large bowl combine the flours and shortening.  Cut in the shortening until only pea or smaller size of shortening remains.
- Add the remianing dry ingredients.  Mix well.  
- At this point you can put the mix in a jar or container with an air tight lid and store for several months. 
- To make muffins add the milk and mix until just combined.  It will be very wet.  Let sit while you grease a muffin tin.  I like to grease my liners too, it helps the muffins not stick as much.  Divide the batter amoung 12 muffin cups. 
- Bake for 25 mins in a preheated 350 degree oven.  
- Let cool for 5 minutes, and enjoy!

When my mother was in college she worked at a summer camp.  They made this oatmeal muffin mix there that she put into her own recpie collection once she left.

When my brother and I came along she would occasionally make them for us.  

In college I had an assignment to make a recipe "healthier".  I chose to make these muffins.  The health factor isn't as strong as the recipe I turned in, but they're a little better for you than the original.

This recipe makes 12 muffins, but you can multiply the recipe and make a mix to keep in your pantry, then just mix it up when you're in the mood for muffins.  The base recipe makes about 3 cups of dry mix.

When I make a big batch I usually triple the amounts (3 cups of oats, etc)
