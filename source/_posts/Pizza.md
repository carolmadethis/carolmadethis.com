Homemade pizza is about as good as it gets.

Melty, cheese-y goodness.

Of course, I'm not eating dairy, so the water gets a little murky when it comes to topping.

There are tons of vegan cheese (or cheeze) to pick from, and many different recipes too.

In this pizza I used two different cheezes. [Follow Your Heart Shredded Mozzarella] and [Avocados and Ale Cheddar Cheese] that I made.  Mine turned out a little less firm that it should have been, but still tasty.

Once you've got your cheeze, you need a crust.

I don't really use a recipe for pizza dough, I've made it enough times I just throw everything together until it looks right.  But so you're less confused, here's an outline of a recipe.

_Pizza Dough_

Warm water (like a hot bath) about 1/2 c

2 t yeast

1 t salt

2 -4 T oil

Flour - about 2 cups, more or less may be needed

- Dissolve the yeast in the hot water.  You can add a teaspoon of sugar to help everything along, but that's optional.
- Once the yeast is beginning to foam up, about 5 minutes, add the salt, oil, and cup of flour.  Mix.  Continue adding flour until adding more flour isn't easily worked in.  Knead the dough for a few minutes, and cover with a damp towel. Put in a warm place, and oven with the light on is good.  And let sit for anywhere from 10 minutes to 1 hour. If you're really ahead of time, you can put the dough into the fridge rather than a warm place.  Simply let the dough warm up on a counter for about an hour before using.
- Remove from the bowl and shape into a pizza crust.

Everything else is basic pizza making.

Take your favorite tomato sauce, spread it on the crust.  Top with cheese and your favorite toppings, I was in the mood  for simple today, so I just roasted some garlic real quick.

Bake in an oven pre-heated to 475 on a pre-heated pizza stone, if you have one.  Depending on the size, and the amount of toppings, it'll take anywhere from 10-20 minutes.

When the pizza is golden brown, remove, let cool, and cut.

Make sure to let the cheeze cool down from lava to hot.  Enjoy!
