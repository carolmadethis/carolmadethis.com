I've had a variety of flours laying around recently.  And one night I decided to mix everything together and make a pancake.  And it was delicious.  
So I wrote it down.

And I made it again.  And it was still delicious.

_Savory Pancakes_
Makes ~10 3 inch pancakes

2 T teff flour
2 T garbanzo bean flour
2 T coconut flour
2 T rye flour
2 T whole wheat flour
1/4 t salt
1/2 t baking powder
1 T sugar 
1 t fructose
2 T Follow Your Heart VeganEgg
1 cup cold water

- Mix together all the dry ingredients.  **You could replace almost any of the flours with something else, but if you replace the coconut flour you're going to have to decrease the water, coconut flours drinks up liquid like nothing else.

- Add 1/2 cup of water, mix, and add 1 T at a time more until you have a thick pancake batter.

- Heat a nonstick pan over medium-low heat for about 5-10 minutes.  Spray with about 1/2 t oil, and pour about 2 T of batter on the oil.  Let cook for about 2-3 minutes.  The top will be nearly dry.  Flip and cook for another minute.  

- Let cool, and serve with a honey-peanut butter sauce.

The fructose causes the pancake to brown much faster (due to the Millard Reaction and fructose being a reducing sugar).
