I've been looking at various food blogs for inspiration.  I tend to find a blog that looks promising, and look around for a while to get inspiration.

One of the blogs was talking about making a turkey flavored seitan to have on a sandwich or something.  And I'm rather obsessed with my new instant pot, so I wanted to use it.
So then I had to figure out how to cook seitan in a pressure cooker, and that took me down a rabbit hole to seitan cooking.

But then I made seitan, and it's delicious!

- Mix together and continue adding broth until a firm dough forms.  Knead for a minute to make sure everything is well combined. Let rest for 5 minutes.
- While the seitan is resting, place broth, water, liquid smoke, and soy sauce in an instant pot (or pressure cooker) and bring to a boil. 
- Form into an oblong log, wrap in cheesecloth, firmly tie the end (leave some space either around, or on the end for expansion if you like a softer seitan).  Place the log in the broth.

- Close the lid, set the pressure cooker time for 30 minutes. 
- Let it naturally release for 10 minutes, or more.  Remove the log from the broth and let cool on your counter for 10-30 minutes.  
- Once a more reasonable temperature, cut off the cheesecloth, and place in a bag or plastic wrap and chill until completly cool (1+ hours).

- Slice thin, and eat on sandwiches, with mashed potatoes and gravy, or on crackers with vegan cream cheese or hummus.
