One of the biggest stereotypes about food blogs is having to scroll through 5 pages of uninteresting nonsense to get to a recipe.  

I'm trying to get back into blogging, in that vein I'm going to be changing some of my old posts to put the recipes first.  

I don't know how long it will take, but I'm going to try, and hey, maybe this will start a trend!
