Egg coffee is something most people don't know about.  It's very Swedish/Midwestern.  My mom's mom made it often at christmas time.  She was of Swedish decent.

It creates a very smooth, light cup of coffee, and all you really need is a pot, a cup, and a spoon.

Water
1 egg
Coffee Grounds

- Bring water to a boil.  I use this camping coffee pot, but you can use a regular pot too.

- In a bowl mix 1 spoonful coffee plus 1, per cup water with 1 egg. (So 8 cups of water would be 9 spoonfuls grounds.  "One per cup, plus one for the pot"  I use a regular tea spoon.  I round it a little bit, so it's probably a scant tablespoon. ) If you're doing a lot of coffee, you can add up to 2 T water to the egg.  It should be a very thick almost gloopy consistancy.

- Once the water is boiling add the grounds.  Make sure to get all of it out!  I stir the spoon once around the pot to make sure everything is off the spoon.  Bring back to a boil.

- Cover the pot and simmer for 5 minutes.  Once the time is up remove from heat and you're good to go!  
- When pouring, usually the first cup needs straining, but everything else, until the last cup, shouldn't have much, if any, sediment in it.

Enjoy your coffee with a sweet in the true Swedish fashion.
